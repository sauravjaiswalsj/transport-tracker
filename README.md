#Transport-Logistic-Tracking 


#Transport-Logistic-Tracking Transport-Logicistic- Tracking is a set of applications designed to track a range of moving assets (such as vehicles) and visualize them on a live map. This codelab is designed to introduce you to the core techniques and APIs used in constructing the Google Transport Tracker.

Note: This application implements asset tracking. For use in a production environment, you therefore need a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license. For more information, see the Google Maps APIs terms of service.
